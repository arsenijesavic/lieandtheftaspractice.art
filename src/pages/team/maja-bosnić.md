Maja Bosnić is a composer and performer of new experimental music from Belgrade. She is drawn to impossible missions, absurd solutions, limited material, playfulness, uncertain outcomes, audience participation, treating instruments as ready-made objects of expression and treating every-day life objects as music instruments. Bosnić is a founder of the Association ZABUNA and has developed, produced and toured with innovative projects around Europe.
