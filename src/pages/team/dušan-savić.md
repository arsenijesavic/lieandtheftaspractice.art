My name is Dušan Savić and I am a curator and art historian. My inabillity not to work ocassionally for art institutions of Serbia gives me an insight to the practices coming from within the institutions while simultaneously I’m trying to contribute to the independent scene. Besides working for the Gallery of Faculty of Fine Arts in Belgrade, Museum of Contemporary Art in Belgrade and curating the Gallery of Belgrade Youth Center, I’ve been a founding team member behind Inex Film Gallery and one of the founders of the independent cultural center Catch 22. Currently I’m working for the Franklin Collection and art collective The Applause Institute.
