Darija Medić is an explorer of (un)coded behavior in the networked world. Finding meaning through making and experiment, she develops exhibition and knowledge exchange formats as an artist, curator and researcher. She works in disciplinary outskirts, in harmony with chaos and wonder, with a strong appetite for change.
