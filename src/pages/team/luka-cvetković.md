I was born in 1995 in Richmond Virginia USA and I’m currently pursuing master's degree at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Belgrade at the sculpture department. I have participated in numerous exhibitions in Serbia and received the awards for my work. I am one of the founders of The Applause Institute, an art collective interested in the performative art in public spaces.
