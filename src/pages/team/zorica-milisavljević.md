Zorica Milisavljević has worked for more than twenty years at the cultural program department of Goethe-Institut in Belgrade as a coordinator of special and long-term projects (e.g. City Guerilla, Urban Incubator, Actopolis, Freiraum, Next Generation). She was a mentor (2010-2017) and one of the founders of the self-organized group City Guerilla. Through this project, she was involved in the processes which encompass the changeability of the pace of unification, functionality and sustainability of this group and its impact on the urban environment in which it was formed.
She is managing the projects ‘Failure as Practice’ (since 2017) and ‘Lie & Theft as Practice’ (since 2019) within the Goethe-Institut’s platform Next Generation.
