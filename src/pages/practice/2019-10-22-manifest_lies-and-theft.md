I steal thus I have

I steal only occasionally

Steal only when necessary

I lie a little, but I do it often

I steal because I’m an authority

I lie because I’m a president

I lie only to my parents (elementary school student)

The one who steals has a lot

The one who lies has no friends, the one who lies too much has lots of enemies

I’m not lying, I’m just embellishing the truth

I lie because it’s free

Cheap lies have the biggest consequences

I’d lie more but there’s only 24 hours in a day

You steal and you go to prison, if you’re caught

No one has seen me/him/her steal / therefore I/he/she never have

I steal to survive

I lie to survive / so they can’t kill me
