Hi, my name is Marko and I'm a 27 years old guy from Kruševac. I'm currently working as a psychologist. My zodiac sign is Aries. I love sports and I've been training to become an MMA fighter. It has been said that I'm great at the ground game. I'm 196cm tall and I'm rarely using perfumes. I am more keen on all natural. Used to play a guitar and I had a rock band, but nowadays I am more of a solo act. I would like to meet you. 

Marko is a made-up online persona born and raised through a compilation of data gathered on Krstarica, a local multipurpose web domain which also includes a chat server based on IRC protocol. I have used a nick name **__mali_lopov_** (the little thief, la petite voleuse), which really explained my intentions in any of the conversations I have started. I was moderately phishing for information from my interlocutors and implementing them to a new person named Marko. After some work on gathering the data, Marko was ready to start his own life in an online environment.
