I've always wanted to be a man,

I was raised by a man,

I competed with men,

But, all of this may be an illusion.

I hate being a woman,

I hate that my skin can bruise easily,

I hate that I bleed regularly,

Before, I hated women,

But, all this may be a lie.

As a teenager I was ashamed of my sexuality,

I was scared of being aroused, even by a thought,

I hated schoolgirls who ended up tossed from one boy to another,

Like some flesh,

Legs held apart, on some boys’ back,

But maybe, I was just being jealous. 

I think of _O_, 

Passivity, degradation, subjective annihilation,

I think of _Justine_, 

Endless protests to her moral indignation,

I think of me,

Self-satisfied disturbia, self-caused frustration, 

Oh, and can it be that I fear the most of being a woman.
