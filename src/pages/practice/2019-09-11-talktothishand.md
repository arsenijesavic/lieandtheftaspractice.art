I am Talking Hands from Instagram – @talktothishand.

Some time ago, I somehow got completely lost in information. \
I think my mind drowned in the sea of ever appearing new content. \
I got confused with my own thoughts and beliefs. \
I doubted everything, as much as I trusted everything. \
I lost all criteria. \
I couldn’t feel my gut anymore. \
Until my intuition was entirely amputated. \
It wasn’t that bad, though. I really liked being alive. \
I just had no idea how am I supposed to live, feel and what kind of thoughts was I supposed to generate. 

Luckily, I discovered a magical enormous world of ideas, quotes, beliefs and thoughts on Instagram. \
Now I am able to find most popular #quotestoliveby every single day and know what my main thoughts and beliefs should be that day. \
It is comforting and assuring to know that you are able to think and react according to what majority on Instagram would do. \
Also, I knew that I would be able to follow the natural changes that slowly appear in the flow of popular thoughts today. 

So that was sorted. \
I became so much accustomed to reading top quotes on Instagram every day, that sometimes, I would confuse the quotes I was living by one day, with the ones I lived by the day before. \
So, day by day, I started selecting fewer quotes. \
Finally, I started picking only two quotes per day and writing them on my hands. \
Quote per palm. \
And then I started publishing them, so that others could possibly remind me, too. Just in case I get completely lost one day. 

While living on Instagram, I learned about the importance of people’s faces. \
Apparently, people need some personal touch to feel closer connection to other profiles. \
Faces cause a great interest of public and get a lot of hearts. \
Especially if they are tagged with emotion, such as #sad, #happy, #crying, #laughing, etc. \
It made great sense to put a face between the two palms with quotes that I pick every day, and hope for more followers, tips and even better quote suggestions. 

Instagram is about community, we all need to share and support each other if we want to have a point of existing there. \
Point of existing on Instagram is proven by the number of followers, of course. \
If no one needs to follow you, why would you be there in the first place, why would you post anything? \
I tried posting engaging comments on other profiles and other people’s quotes, and see if I start an interaction of some kind. I only got one heart for one of my comments. I guess I should increase the number of comments I post, in order to increase the chances of getting a reaction to some of them. \
It seems reasonable. \
Just like you increase the odds for getting a job interview by sending over 100 CVs to different adds. \
So, I will have to try and comment and heart more. 

Today, I am one week old. \
My Instagram insights say that I have had 30 profile visits in the last 7 days, I have reached 27 accounts and made 57 impressions. \
I don’t yet know from what regions of the world my audience is from, because I need at least 100 followers. \
But, at the moment I know that I have 32 followers, while I’m following 95 accounts. \
In my first week I created 21 posts and most popular one is my right hand palm with “this is all there is to it” written on it. \
I will continue to post two most popular quotes on Instagram on my palms, next to my face, every day. \
And I will try to comment and heart more. \
Let’s see how I grow. \
Let’s see how I do.
