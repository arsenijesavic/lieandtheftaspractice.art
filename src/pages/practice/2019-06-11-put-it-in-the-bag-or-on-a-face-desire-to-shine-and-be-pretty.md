Rolled aluminum foil - during the rehearsal and preparation before performing, I took the aluminum foil roll, that was needed to wrapp the props, and put it in my bag. There were people in the space, so the act of stealing were dramatic and exciting for me.

It was very uncomfortable watching colleagues looking for a foil between costumes and props, unsuccessfully. And also, watching my colleague, who started wrapping props with plastic bags, instead of foil.

I felt malicious, because I took something very important at that moment.

Lipstick / lip gloss - I was alone in the bedroom, at the moment. I just opened the vanity case of one of my friends/colleagues, which was on my bed, and decided not to steal powder, but the lipstick, it may be necessary, one day.
