My name is Jasminka Krtolica.

I have a son, he is my everything, my little angel and the best soccer player! He is going to be the new Ronaldo, I know it.

I am divorced, because I believe that I deserve more from life than to spend my whole life with just one man.

The main thing that I live by is vortex - the positive energy and good vibrations are what defines your life.

Since my divorce, I mostly interact with man, I deserve to be happy and to have someone who will not put me down, but follow me in my life and treat me like a queen.

I work as a hairdresser, with my best friend, so I have a lot of girlfriends as well.

All I want in my and my son’s life is to be healthy and happy and if you believe it, you will be it.
