\#lie + #theft 

as 

\#practice / #starting #point

\#makse #sense #simply #because #demand for #speed and #content is constantly #growing and #everybody #must **\#deliver**

\#must #answer #must #say #must #make #must #do #nomatterwhat

\#delivering #fast is #professionalism and #boosts #rating

\#delivering is #priority 

\#validity #genuinity #notsomuch

\#must #search #must #find #must #makeup

\#content

\#interesting #fun #useful #smart #good #bad #whatever #eyecatching #content

.

.

.

\#Now, when you #think about it :

\#Using what you already #have , being who you already are , is a #waste .

.

\#Know that we all must #lie :

in order to #extend our #minds , #ideas , points of #view , #imagination , #plans , #thoughts , and #feelings .

\#Know that we all must #steal :

in order to #upgrade our personal #environment , #knowledge , #experience , #credits , #ratings , and #opportunities .

.

\#Because

Through the #process of frequent or constant #lying and #stealing , we will bring down the #borders of our #personality and be #free to #grow and mutate . 

\#Lie and #theft is #freedom . It is a blank #canvas . A #gift of a #new #self . #New #environment . #Road to #unknown and #unexpected . It can be whatever we #want and #need , as well as #nothing we are #comfortable with . It is a #new #learning #process , new #discovery , with so many things to #encounter , #accept , #practice and , only #optionally : #achieve .

.

\#Understand that :

One must not be #lazy to #present the #world as it plainly is .

One must not #rely on the #heritage of their own #possessions , for they can #never be #enough , or as many .

One must #keep on #reinventing , #modifying and #growing anew in order to harvest #precious new #experiences of various #new #selves that they go on #testing .

.

\#Accept that :

One must #lie to #push #beyond their known #limits .

One must #lie to #create #space for their #growth .

One must #steal to be #economical .

One must #steal to have a #backup .

One must #steal to get #attached to the #unknown .

One must #steal to #learn .
