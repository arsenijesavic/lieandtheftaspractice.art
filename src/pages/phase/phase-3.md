**Next Generation: Lie & Theft as Practice**\
**Magacin, Kraljevića Marka 4-6, Belgrade**

The September workshop of the two-year project "Lie and Theft as Practice", led by Darko Dragičević, is a phase during which collaborators will work on developing movement and speech practices through methodologies derived from contemporary dance, performing and visual arts.

During this two-week phase, we aim to critically analyze the roles and responsibilities of contemporary artistic practices in the pervasive toxic states of society, as well as its effects on the irreversible consequences on the future of our planet. The role of the individual within the group, as well as questions of the authorship through artistic exchanges, are just some of the motives that will serve as materials for the long-term development of potentially embodied solutions.

The first week of the project aims to strengthen the neutral space, the foundations of which are based on mutual trust and support. Tasks and scores from contemporary performing practices will serve to further shape the emerging forms of exchange and collaboration.

During the second week, we will be working on the development of the choreographic materials that will be presented to the public individually, as well as the entire group as a whole, on Friday, September 20th from 8 pm to 10 pm at the premises of the Magacin Cultural Center in Belgrade. This event is also the first presentation of collaborators on the project to the public.
