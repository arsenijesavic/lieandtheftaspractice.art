**Next Generation: Lie & Theft as Practice**

online

Following the formation of the ten-member group, in the first phase of work on the _Lie & Theft as Practice_ project we will launch a number of performance processes through which we wish to contextualize practices that will be an integral part of the contents we will be working on in the course of 2019 and 2020. The second phase is aimed at introductions, presenting each of the participants to the rest of the group, beginning an exchange of ideas with regards to the terms _lie_ and _theft,_ as well as their potential powers and influence on the devising, development and formation of directions within the framework of artistic creation.\
Personal and collective approaches, as newly-found soulutions, will be available via an online platform which will serve as a kind of laboratory through which the processes that have been newly devised by the group will be presented to the public as well.  In the course of the second phase in the month of May, ten associates on the project will have an opportunity to reflect on already existing analytical and critical processes by using different forms of artistic practices, and then commence a two-year round of such processes through which they will open new chapters on the assigned topic by way of discourse.\
Collectivism, as a priority, represents the basis of the newly-formed community, the aim of which is to create its own contents, solely by means of cooperation and exchange between its members. This way, we wish to initiate discussions or perhaps offer answers as solutions to certain situations from the grids of the everyday that result from the social-political apparatus.

Phase II, with a duration of two weeks, at the same time represents a platform in the course of which two tasks will be carried out.
