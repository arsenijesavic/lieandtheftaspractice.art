**Next Generation: Lie & Theft as Practice** **Goethe-Institut** **50, Knez Mihailova Street** **Belgrade** _It has been said that lying is moral._ – Matthew Brannon, Interview with Rosa Vanina Pavone, _Uovo_ (April 2006) The first phase of work on the project titled _Lie & Theft as Practice_ conducted by artist Darko Dragičević within Goethe-Institut’s _Next Generation_ platform constitutes the formation of a team of ten local associates who represent various artistic disciplines. The selection and formation of the transdisciplinary group will be performed on the basis of the exchange of information through which we wish to shake the foundations of the widely known connotation that follows the terms lie and theft, as well as their powers of transformation into newly-devised formats of artistic creation. Our aim is to create a group the members of which are ready to continually take part in a two-year-long cooperation in the construction of materials that will serve as archival objects. Processes of cross-examining the individual body and the knowledge it incorporates, that same body with regards to a different body, and finally the society itself, will serve as materials for introductions, exchange and the creation of a community in which we further interpret the credibility of omnipresent system values through the implementation of a number of practices as potential parameters. From this stand on “cultural capital” we will bring into question the power of archiving itself, as well as the issue of copyrights. In addition to performing arts, the project participants will be given an opportunity to develop textual, digital, musical scores, etc. In the course of the last day of the March phase, the newly-selected participants of the _Lie & Theft as Practice_ project will have a chance, for the first time, to jointly open and begin a dialogue on an assigned two-year topic within the formed group. What follows is a number of workshops in September, November and December of 2019, as well as an exchange of online tasks during the month of May of this current year.
