When a friend asked me _how are you?_ I replied _Great, and you?_ She replied _me too._ 

\- excerpt from the _Diary of Lana Pavkov,_ Belgrade, May 2, 2020

The eight phase “Lie & Theft as Practice” is also the last one of a two-year project. The project itself could not be realized as it was conceived due to the situation with the Covid19 pandemic. This impossibility was mainly reduced to cooperation in the context of performative interventions in the public spaces of Belgrade. The situation with the virus brought us closer within the group itself. Spaces of collaborations based on the principles of togetherness, exchange, empathy and vulnerability, in themselves, naturally developed further between artistic collaborators.

The topics we deal with day by day are becoming strategies of international policies with the support of most international institutions in which the role of the individual, as well as entire communities, is incresingly on the margins. When we bring in the role and position of artists, as well as cultural workers, not to mention those who deal with the independent cultural scene, then the picture of the current situation becomes completely clear. This is where the question then arises; what is actually true, what is theft? I claim that there is not so much talk about lies, even theft, because we all know that they are there and that they are so recognizable. Issues related to the notion of truth are topics for discourse and dialogue. It is within the framework of finding these answers that we come to the realization that each of us on a daily basis only ’performs’ values that also support the machineries that ’teach’ us what they actually mean. In that way, we are actually creating a history that we all collectively stand for, and which we no longer understand at all.

The artistic team of the project “Lie & theft as Practice” composed of six young and brave individuals, will be joined by a group of international activists, artists and cultural workers across Europe. These are Pia Brezavšček (SI), Christina Ciupke (DE), Ann Cotten (AT), Marijana Cvetković (RS), Konstantina Georgelou (GR/NL), Margrét Sara Guðjónsdóttir (ISL/DE) and Martin Sonderkamp (DE/SE).

Together, we are currently collecting materials created during 2019 and 2020, which we will combine in a book called “Lie & Theft as Practice”, the first working version of which we will send to press in December this year.
