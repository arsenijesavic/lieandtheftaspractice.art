The last paragraph of the text for the previous phase of the project, related to the terms ’’lie and theft as practice’’ reads: _…Furthermore, if they are erected on already existing constructs, they could provide alternative ways in which failure, empathy or different kinds of vulnerabilities, could provide the new tools of resisting the overall powers of consumption coming from political and economical machineries._

This text was written in late January 2020. By the end of February, the Corona happened. The virus has spread throughout the world. During the course of this virus, many people have lost their lives, and the uncertainties that continue to accompany us every day make us more vulnerable than we were before the virus situation. More vulnerable certainly in a positive way.

Every day we get information about the consequences of the current situation. The ’’consequences“ are mainly related to the economic state of society.

The Coronavirus situation seems to have led us to finally reflect on some of the key issues that make up our daily lives and to ask ourselves, once again, perhaps for the last time, whether we still want to live in a world whose future is already well known scenario?

In contexts of lies and theft, I often think that these are actually two of the most basic values of modern society. It is enough to take as an example almost all of today’s cultural institutions e.g. world museums and read a list of their major sponsors. It mainly lists major oil companies, and even those companies that, in their financing history, play a major role in world wars solely out of interest.

Knowing this, then we must question what is inevitable: what is the role of the individual in that society? How much does that individual or entire social groups, not to mention minorities!, in any social system across the globe have any rights or in the broadest sense of the power to change at all the systems that have evolved over the past decades and then emerged over this century?

Large corporations, behind which very few incredibly powerful people stand, decide the future of our planet and inevitably the future of all living beings on that planet.

I find that Coronavirus provides a space where new ideas can emerge that will create spaces for dialogue, discourse formation, and afterwards, which will provide opportunities to change a system that is by no means good and whose outcome is terrifying. It is now up to us to recognize that moment and so something about it.

It is in such a given environment that it is important to start from the small steps, always having in front of you the idea of developing a bigger picture of yourself as an individual as part of the social community.

The role of art is to keep up with its contents in parallel to the development of the situation and to go one step ahead, following motto of Joseph Beuys “Every human being is an artist.“ Only then does art cease to be purely elitist and become purely activist.

During the sixth phase of work on the project “Lie and Theft as Practice“, instead of the planned interventions in the public space, a group of six artistic collaborators will continue to relate to each other through new tasks and continue to strengthen the established collective body, this time in contexts of related situations with the development of the Coronavirus. These tasks are aimed at rethinking, self-reflection and inevitable criticism through the prisms of the documentation process, through which we will try to leave a mark that will surely have some echo in the broadest contexts of the future developments of humanity today. Maybe like some sort of victories or complete crashes.

Lastly, I would like to end this introductory text for Phase VI of the “Lie and Theft as Practice“ project with Ann Cotten text I had read in her 2016 book _Lather in Heaven_:

_Beauty cannot lie, not without using its complete existence. And then of course you could say that the beauty of lying is that it changes your complete existence._
