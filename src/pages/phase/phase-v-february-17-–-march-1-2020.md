Prior to the encounter in February in Belgrade the artistic collaborators on the project _Lie & Theft as Practice_ will engage with two practical tasks over the course of five weeks. The purpose of these tasks are the implementations in urban landscape. Their aim is the engagement of the group in the upcoming site-specific formats that will further develop over this year during different phases.

The outcomes of the documented materials will be presented to the rest of the group in the first week of the Workshop in February.

With site-specific actions in public space we are aiming to try out and experiment with various practice based possibilities in which those that were  already applied over the past year in the studio space, and during which the collective body between the group members was created, will be further applied on the streets of Belgrade. In this way, using different media as political strategies in which the bodies play the main tools of resistance, we want to observe, question and ulitmately implement parallel lines of actions. Visible, or maybe even invisible at first glance.

We believe in the necessities of the reconfigurations in deeply rooted and instrumentalized ‘facts’.

Staying within the frame of performative practices we are posing a question: _How can art be more politically engaged in these times of extremely precarious political and economical turmoil? What is the role of individual during these shifts in relation with the others? How can we support each other in more meaningful ways in order to create the arguments that could, perhaps, reach out to the others?_ We want to increase the awareness that systems need to be questioned over and over again in order to create a discourse. Without discourses or alternative ways of being and functioning our own purposes are lost. 

For us, the discourse as a critique needs to be applied in practice and always in relation to other bodies in the public space.

We do not want to associate the terms lie and theft with exclusively negative connotations. If these terms are used in more imaginary or even more original ways they could lead to the creations of more positive outcomes.

Furthermore, if they are erected on already existing constructs, they could provide alternative ways in which failure, empathy or different kinds of vulnerabilities, could provide the new tools of resisting the overall powers of consumption coming from political and economical machineries.
