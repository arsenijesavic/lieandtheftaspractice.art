**Next Generation: Lie & Theft as Practice**\
**Magacin, Kraljevića Marka 4-6, Belgrade**

Last, 4th phase of the project ‘Lie & Theft as Practice’ in the year 2019 starts with two Workshops by two German choreographers and dance artists Martin Sonderkamp and Christina Ciupke. 

First Workshop which will be held from Friday, November 22nd until Sunday, November 24th is with Martin Sonderkamp currently teaching as Professor of Choreography at DOCH – Stockholm University of The Arts.

About the field of research within the overall topic of ‘Lie & Theft as Practice’, Martin Sonderkamp says the following:

_The workshop serves as a platform to sample the ideas, methods and materials that the artists of Lie and Theft have realized since the beginning of the project. Stealing is translated into amicable lending and borrowing and lying into appropriating through embodying and becoming. Each artist explores, in a short time, methods of transmission and transposition, re-play and imitation and is challenged to develop the necessary skills to perform the work created._

Second workshop from November 29th to December 1st, 2019 is with Berlin based choreographer and performer Christina Ciupke. For the purposes of the Workshop Christina Ciupke writes the following:

_Everything that is processed by memory is, to some extent, fiction and appropriation of various sources. We continuously mix our own stories and references with the stories of others. The process of memory is voluntary and involuntary, conscious and unconscious, an ongoing layering of collective memory._ 

_When does reality blur? Where are the limits of fiction?_ 

_Do we walk a blurred line between fact and fiction, between appropriation and theft, when we tell the story of a story, when we write a poem inspired by another poem, when we write a line of text, when we improvise a movement that is always based on the memory of a movement, when we reinvent a song that we hardly remember?_

_In the workshop Lie & Theft as Practice I want to give an impulse to retrace how to think about the original, the real, the own and the alienated._

Furthermore, 10 days period after the second Workshop will serve to reflect, discuss and deepen the dialogue with the artistic collaborators of the project ‘Lie & Theft as Practice’ which will be used to deepen and further facilitate the upcoming collaboration in 2020 but also to start the processes of archival and selection of the materials for the book/catalogue under the same title.
