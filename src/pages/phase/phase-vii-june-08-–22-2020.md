_This erosion of individual privacy can be benign or malevolent. But it is already a part of life in the Anthropocene._ 

\    Gaia Vince



Phase VII of the project ’’Lie & Theft as Practice“ is the completion or continuation of the processes that occured during 2019 and 2020. During this phase, artistic collaborators will have the opportunity to implement feedback into the processes of their colleagues. Feedback will be in textual and visual form.

In this way, we once again want to address copyright issues in the broader contexts of artistic creation.



Since the coronavirus is still going on, we will not be able to collaborate in Belgrade and continue with interventions in public space. Because of this situation, we continue online collaboration during which we further expand the virtual spaces, which are certainly becoming the most powerful tools of the resistance system.

Through online networks, people around the world organize public gatherings, demonstrations and protest walks. It is important that we collectively recognize the possibilities of change in them at such specific moment in time.



Around the world, there are spaces of continents, countries and cities, as well as people who live in them. Today, there are virtual – online spaces – invisible continents, countries and cities, as well as their inhabitants, who know no physical boundaries, as well as measures of social systems of everyday life.

It is important to work on empowering virtual spaces, as well as their inhabitants – people around the world, who by exchanging ideas make friends, create pressure for change, innovation, as well as the spread of political and artistic talents. These are spaces where, through dialogue with others, because of our anonymity, we can resist systems through shared creativity in problem solving.



Our task and obligation is to recognize this moment that cries out for change, and which excludes a return to a ’’normal“ state before the onset of the virus. If we recognize it, that moment will enable us to no longer step into the one-way streets that we have collectively built, but to imagine and start with the construction of a wide boulevard.

At this point, nothing can be worse than a return to ’’normality“.
