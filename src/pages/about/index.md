**Lie & Theft as Practice (2019)**

within the platform Next Generation (Goethe-Institut Serbia)

Our society is continuously challenged with multiple turmoil. Planet is revolting, people are migrating, more and more animal species are closer to their extinction. Yet, we feel that the ways in which we are consuming the life of everyday, even producing any kind of labor, is highly informed and based on one owns truth. But what really lies beneath the post-capitalist machinery is the world entirely constructed on restrictions and manipulations of what could be called our collective knowledge. Role of individual is permanently lost in the pool of replicas and re-inventions within the context of neoliberal system. Belonging is the crucial point, we chose and merge with the others and this way we construct zones of comfort known as micro communities. In global terms all these communities, that all of us belong to!, imagine to rely on questions of truth, trust and beliefs. But what really constructs these beliefs is something beyond, sometimes ungraspable. Human is becoming more and more aware of the constructs of our own identities questioning their background, their values. We often understand that there is no way out from the system that’s been created and that is existing. We are faced with the facts that our reality is mostly based on Lies and Theft. These two terms have direct associations with something that is negative but we believe that what we trust is truth is also finding its roots in something that has been borrowed or said differently. That’s why, we want to examine the transformative powers of these two terms into the new modes of individual and collective thinking as we believe there is a lot to be recognized, questioned and placed in practice..

Lie & Theft as Practice will be one-year process stretching over the next year of 2019. This process will be continuously shared, as practice, with its participants but also within the various formats of presentations that will be shared with the audiences outside this group.

Our aim is to analytically approach the topic of Lie & Theft as Practice implementing them in various socio-political and cultural contexts.
