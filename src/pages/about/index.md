The selection and formation of the transdisciplinary group will be performed on the basis of the exchange of information through which we wish to shake the foundations of the widely known connotation that follows the terms lie and theft, as well as their powers of transformation into newly-devised formats of artistic creation. \r\n\nOur aim is to create a group the members of which are ready to continually take part in a two-year-long cooperation in the construction of materials that will serve as archival objects.   \r\n\nProcesses of cross-examining the individual body and the knowledge it incorporates, that same body with regards to a different body, and finally the society itself, will serve as materials for introductions, exchange and the creation of a community in which we further interpret the credibility of omnipresent system values through the implementation of a number of practices as potential parameters. From this stand on “cultural capital” we will bring into question the power of archiving itself, as well as the issue of copyrights.  \r\n\nIn addition to performing arts, the project participants will be given an opportunity to develop textual, digital, musical scores, etc. \r\n\nIn the course of the last day of the March phase, the newly-selected participants of the _Lie & Theft as Practice_ project will have a chance, for the first time, to jointly open and begin a dialogue on an assigned two-year topic within the formed group. \r\n\nWhat follows is a number of workshops in September, November and December of 2019, as well as an exchange of online tasks during the month of May of this current year."

This way, we wish to initiate discussions or perhaps offer answers as solutions to certain situations from the grids of the everyday that result from the social-political apparatus.\r\n\nPhase II, with a duration of two weeks, at the same time represents a platform in the course of which two tasks will be carried out."

**Lie & Theft as Practice (2019)**\
within the platform Next Generation (Goethe-Institut Serbien)

Our society is continuously challenged with multiple turmoil. Planet is revolting, people are migrating, more and more animal species are closer to their extinction. Yet, we feel that the ways in which we are consuming the life of everyday, even producing any kind of labor, is highly informed and based on one owns truth. But what really lies beneath the post-capitalist machinery is the world entirely constructed on restrictions and manipulations of what could be called our collective knowledge. Role of individual is permanently lost in the pool of replicas and re-inventions within the context of neoliberal system. Belonging is the crucial point, we chose and merge with the others and this way we construct zones of comfort known as micro communities. In global terms all these communities, that all of us belong to!, imagine to rely on questions of truth, trust and beliefs. But what really constructs these beliefs is something beyond, sometimes ungraspable. Human is becoming more and more aware of the constructs of our own identities questioning their background, their values. We often understand that there is no way out from the system that’s been created and that is existing. We are faced with the facts that our reality is mostly based on Lies and Theft. These two terms have direct associations with something that is negative but we believe that what we trust is truth is also finding its roots in something that has been borrowed or said differently. That’s why, we want to examine the transformative powers of these two terms into the new modes of individual and collective thinking as we believe there is a lot to be recognized, questioned and placed in practice..

Lie & Theft as Practice will be one-year process stretching over the next year of 2019. This process will be continuously shared, as practice, with its participants but also within the various formats of presentations that will be shared with the audiences outside this group.

Our aim is to analytically approach the topic of Lie & Theft as Practice implementing them various socio-political and cultural contexts.
